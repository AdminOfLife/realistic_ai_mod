<h1>Pros and Cons of 2D Hardware Blitting under Win32</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p><b>2D Hardware YUV Overlays are good, because:</b> </p><p>1) They are super-fast (you don't blit them to the screen, you just draw onto the surface and the pixels appear). </p><p>2) They have clipping built-in. </p><p>3) They float above your window, so they don't disturb anything in your application. </p><p>4) They can do shrinking and stretching for free, CPU-wise. </p><p><br> <b>2D Hardware YUV overlays are bad, because:</b> </p><p>1) They are hardware (so you are at the mercy of the video card and video card DirectDraw drivers). </p><p>2) They can look different on different video cards (especially when stretching). </p><p>3) They float above your window, so it's hard to make them seem completely integrated into your application. </p><p>4) They are usually disabled when Direct3D is running. </p><p><br> <b>2D Hardware YUV off-screen buffers are good because:</b> </p><p>1) They are fast (fast, that is, as long as the YUV conversion is done in hardware - some DirectDraw drivers do the conversion on the host CPU). </p><p>2) They can usually perform clipping for free. </p><p>3) They basically work like just like a normal blitter (so they aren't any different than plain old off-screen blitters that we all know how to use). </p><p>4) They can do shrinking and stretching for free, CPU-wise. </p><p><br> <b>2D Hardware YUV converting-blitters are bad, because:</b> </p><p>1) Again, they are in hardware, so you are at the mercy of the video hardware and drivers working correctly. And in 3D, that's rarely. </p><p>2) They can be doing the conversion in software and not telling you. </p><p>3) They can look different on different video cards (again, especially when stretching). </p>
