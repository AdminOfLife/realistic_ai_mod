So, if you hate 'em, then it's my fault. But if you like them, well, that's my fault too... Special thanks to Mitch Soule, John Miles, Casey Muratori, Mike Sartain, Mike Abrash, and my wife, Alicia Fukunaga, someone I try to be more like. </p><p>Mark Engleberg and I did the original research work on Bink. David Lawrence at Blizzard did much of the heavy lifting of porting Bink to MacOS (and he tolerated many questions). Mike Sartain did the port to GameCube and wrote several of the Xbox examples. Mike Sartain also got the PS2 port up and running. Lee Powell, John Miles and Mike Abrash all wrote YUV blitters over the years. David Etherton was also amazingly helpful in getting the PS2 port wrapped up. Jason Dorie had the good idea of using palettes with 3D hardware to do color conversion in hardware on some older platforms. </p><p>Thanks also to Brian Kearney, Ken Coburn, Chris Hecker, Access Software, Microsoft (both for the nice tools and the tough competition), and all our Bink and Smacker licensees. </p><p>RAD's automatic documentation system was written by Casey Muratori. </p><p><img src="amd64.jpg"> Thanks to AMD for their kind support during the development of Bink for Windows 64! </p><p>This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group. </p><p>All brand and product names mentioned in this documentation are trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective companies. </p>
